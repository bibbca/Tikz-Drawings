# Tikz-Drawings

This repository is a collection of my Tikz Drawings sorted by their basic shapes.
I also include my source code so you can use them as well.

Created using [TikzEdt](https://github.com/mkantem/tikzedt/) and can be rendered in [LaTeX](https://github.com/latex3/latex3). 
However, I think it is easiest to use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
